Squarespace CSS code that I use all the time, not much of a coder so I'm contributing what I do know!

I always tell myself I won't put any custom CSS on the Squarespace sites I'm coding. But then I always do. 

### Some tips
— To identify the code block in Squarespace download the Google Chrome extension [Block ID](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/squarespace-collectionblo/bggpdfnccodbnmcndckmeehdjkjojkde/related?hl=en-US)  
— You have to upgrade the membership one tier to use custom code  
— To edit this you have to go to Design > Custom CSS >
